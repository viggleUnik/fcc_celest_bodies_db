# Celestial-Bodies-Dabatase
This is the result to complete the Celestial Bodies Database project. 
Instructions for building this project can be found at 
[https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-celestial-bodies-database-project/build-a-celestial-bodies-database](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-celestial-bodies-database-project/build-a-celestial-bodies-database)

## Instructions
For this project, you need to log in to PostgreSQL with psql to create your database. Do that by entering `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres` in the terminal. Make all the tests below pass to complete the project. Be sure to get creative, and have fun!

**Don't forget to connect to your database after you create it** ðŸ˜„

Here's some ideas for other column and table names: `description`, `has_life`, `is_spherical`, `age_in_millions_of_years`, `planet_types`, `galaxy_types`, `distance_from_earth`.

Notes:
If you leave your virtual machine, your database may not be saved. You can make a dump of it by entering `pg_dump -cC --inserts -U freecodecamp universe > universe.sql` in a bash terminal (not the psql one). It will save the commands to rebuild your database in `universe.sql`. The file will be located where the command was entered. If it's anything inside the `project` folder, the file will be saved in the VM. You can rebuild the database by entering `psql -U postgres < universe.sql` in a terminal where the `.sql` file is.

If you are saving your progress on [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), after getting all the tests to pass, follow the instructions above to save a dump of your database. Save the `universe.sql` file in a public repository and submit the URL to it on [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## CodeRoad
1. You should create a database named `universe`.
2. Be sure to connect to your database with `\c universe`. Then, you should add tables named `galaxy`, `star`, `planet`, and `moon`.
3. Each table should have a `primary key`.
4. Each `primary key` should automatically increment.
5. Each table should have a `name` column.
6. You should use the `INT` data type for at least two columns that are not a primary or foreign key.
7. You should use the `NUMERIC` data type at least once.
8. You should use the `TEXT` data type at least once.
9. You should use the `BOOLEAN` data type on at least two columns.
10. Each `star` should have a `foreign key` that references one of the rows in `galaxy`.
11. Each `planet` should have a `foreign key` that references one of the rows in `star`.
12. Each `moon` should have a `foreign key` that references one of the rows in `planet`.
13. Your database should have at least five `tables`.
14. Each table should have at least three rows.
15. The `galaxy` and `star` tables should each have at least six rows.
16. The `planet` table should have at least 12 rows.
17. The `moon` table should have at least 20 rows.
18. Each table should have at least three columns.
19. The `galaxy`, `star`, `planet`, and `moon` tables should each have at least five columns.
20. At least two columns per table should not accept `NULL` values.
21. At least one column from each table should be required to be `UNIQUE`.
22. All columns named name should be of type `VARCHAR`.
23. Each `primary key` column should follow the naming convention `table_name_id`. For example : the `moon` table should have a `primary key` column named `moon_id`.
24. Each `foreign key` column should have the same name as the `column` it is referencing.
